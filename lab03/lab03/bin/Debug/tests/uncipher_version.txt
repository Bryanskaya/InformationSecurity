London has the largest student population of any British city, although not the highest per capita.

The federal University of London, which, with over 120,000 students, is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom 
(smaller only than the distance-education Open University) and one of the largest Universities in Europe. It comprises 19 colleges and 12 
institutes, as well as a distance-learning External System.[1] Constituent colleges have a high degree of autonomy, controlling their own 
admissions and degree programmes, and are effectively universities in their own right. The largest and most well-known University of London 
colleges include (in order of student population size) King's College London, University College London, Birkbeck, Queen Mary, the London 
School of Economics and Political Science, Royal Holloway, Goldsmiths, and the Institute of Education. Smaller schools and institutes (with 
fewer than 5,000 students) include the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), the London Business School, the School of Pharmacy, 
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, St. George's Hospital Medical School and Central School of Speech and Drama. Traditionally 
all of the University of London institutions awarded degrees from the University of London itself, and not from the individual college or 
institution, but this changed in 2007/2008 when King's College London, the London School of Economics, University College London and the 
Institute of Education remained within the University of London system, but began awarding their own degrees.[2] Imperial College London was a 
part of the University of London until 2007, but is now a separate institution.

There are also other universities not part of the University of London, most of which were polytechnics until UK polytechnics were granted 
university status by a 1992 Act of Parliament. Among these are the University of Westminster, London South Bank University, University of 
Greenwich, City University, London, Middlesex University, London Metropolitan University, Brunel University, University of West London, the 
University of East London, and various other higher education institutions.

There are also a large number of specialised institutions, branches of UK universities based outside London, branches of foreign universities, 
and private universities and training colleges.
